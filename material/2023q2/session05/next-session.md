### Optional

There are three topics you could introduce next week. This would count toward your in-class participation grade. If you want to present one of them, announce this on this week's forum on Aula Global. In this way others will know that the topic is already taken. 

  1. Give an introduction to *Constituency and Constituency Grammars*, based on Jurafsky & Martin's Chapter 12 (from the beginning of the chapter to the end of 12.3). This counts as two in-class participation grades.
  
  2. Explain some challenges of *Constituency parsing*, based on Jurafsky & Martin's Chapter 13 (from the beginning of the chapter to the end of 13.1)

  3. Give an introduction to *Dependencies and dependency parsing*, based on Jurafsky & Martin's Chapter 14 (from the beginning of the chapter to the end of 14.3). Thematize the relationship and differences between constituents and dependencies. This counts as two in-class participation grades.
