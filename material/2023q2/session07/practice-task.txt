Argentina - UAB (2016)

Lionel Messi played the full 90 minutes and got on the scoresheet as Argentina beat the United Arab Emirates 5-0 in their final World Cup warmup match.

The Argentina captain scored their fourth goal just before the break as the pre-tournament favourites stretched their unbeaten run to 36 games. Messi also set up Manchester City’s Julián Álvarez to open the scoring in the 17th minute, and has now scored 10 goals in his past four international matches.

Ángel Di María also showed he is approaching peak form with two fine first-half goals in Abu Dhabi, superbly volleying home Marcos Acuña’s cross at the far post in the 25th minute. The Juventus winger, who has recovered from a thigh injury in time for Qatar, dribbled through the hosts’ defence 11 minutes later to score his second.

France - Australia (2022)

Giroud ties record as France pummels Australia

Not tonight! That's what France shouted in Qatar as the game came to a close. The French national team saw Argentina vs Saudi Arabia and didn't want to face the same consequences. There are no small rivals, every team should always know this, a saying as old as the sport, yet teams never seem to learn it. Well, the French did so for 83 minutes. Australia was better in the first 7 minutes, and they went up in the game.

Australia also saw the Argentina game. They also believed they could win this. For a bit, they did do the miracle. But this is too much France. This is too much of a team. Mbappe and Dembele started to get in the game, and from the right and left, the blue wave came, and Australia tried to hold on as much as possible.

Iran - England (2022): 6-2

First up, it was England with a point to prove, and oh how they proved it. After being denied a clear penalty early on, England finally got their goal 35 minutes in. 

It was Liverpool’s number one transfer target Jude Bellingham that gave the Three Lions the lead with a fantastic header, reminiscent of his idol Steven Gerrard’s in the 2005 Champions League final. 

Southgate’s men soon made it two then three just before halftime. Bakayo Saka’s outstanding finish after Harry Maguire knocking it back to him doubled their lead and Raheem Sterling added the third after wonderful work by Harry Kane. 

After the break, the game continued to go down the same path. Arsenal’s Saka added another for himself after tricking two Iranian defenders to then place it past the keeper with ease.

Harry Maguire then got caught sleeping and Iran got a shock goal through Mehdi Taremi, which did not go down well with Jordan Pickford. 

Substitutes Marcus Rashford and Jack Grealish added yet more goals for England, making it 6-1. However, Iran weren’t done either, Taremi scoring his second, this time from the spot. 

England’s empathic 6-2 win against the 20th ranked in the world sets a marker down for the rest of the teams. They play USA on Friday next.
