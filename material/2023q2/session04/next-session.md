# NLP session 04: Preparation for next session

 * Read Yoav Goldberg's [A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00726), at least until page 35
 * If you don't know or don't remember how to [multiply matrices](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/a/multiplying-matrices) or [vectors with matrices](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/matrix_vector_mult/) make sure to look it up.

### Optional

There is one topic you could introduce next week. This would count toward your in-class participation grade. If you want to present one of them, announce this on this week's forum on Aula Global. In this way, others will know that the topic is already taken. 

  1. Explain matrix and vector multiplication through brief examples and exercises (5-20 minutes)
