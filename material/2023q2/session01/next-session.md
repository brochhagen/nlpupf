# Preparation for next session

 * Read [Jurafsky & Martin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)'s Chapter 2: "[Regular Expressions, Text Normalization, Edit Distance](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/2.pdf)"
 * Go to [https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101):
   * Read the entire presentation page. Don't worry if you don't understand everything. You will at the end of the class. 
   * Work through the first 4 sections from Chapter 1 of the free interactive course "Advanced NLP with spaCy": [https://course.spacy.io/en/](https://course.spacy.io/en/)

### Optional

There are two topics you could introduce next week, counting toward your in-class participation grade. If you want to present one of them, announce this on this week's forum on Aula Global. In this way, others will know that the topic is already taken. 

  1. Give a broad summary of Regular Expressions (3-5 minutes), based on Jurafsky & Martin's Chapter 2
  2. Introduce spacy by (i) briefly saying what it is (1-3 minutes) and (ii) walk the class through the spaCy exercises found in `session0202-spaCyIntro.ipynb`
