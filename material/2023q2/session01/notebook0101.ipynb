    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to **N**atural **L**anguage **P**rocessing! This class gives an introduction to central aspects of natural language processing. It puts its main emphasis on hands-on experience with the acquisition, manipulation, curation, and processing of linguistic data. It covers both symbolic and statistical methods, from a theoretical and practical angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central goal of this class is for you to acquaint yourself with state of the art techniques used in industry and academia to structure language data and extract information from it; as well as to empower you to apply this knowledge to new problems outside the scope of this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, you will learn to reason about problems and tasks that arise when processing linguistic information. On the other, you will learn about common methods and approaches to address them. My suggestion: Focus on the former, but keep the latter in mind for when you need it.\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "  * They look nice but do not write \"heavy duty\" scripts in Jupyter notebooks. Use them for dynamic presentations (or smaller scripts and collaborations)\n",
    "  * Comment your code extensively\n",
    "  * Document your choices\n",
    "  * Use virtual environments (e.g., [ana]conda) for your projects\n",
    "  * Use the language that is most convenient to you whenever you can. For this class, python and R are admissible\n",

    "### Short instructor bio\n",
    "\n",
    "Thomas is a professor in computational linguistics / computational cognitive science at the UPF. He's particularly interested in the way language is structured: why it is the way it is and how it came to be that way. To answer these questions, he sometimes gets people in the lab; sometimes he uses artificial agents to simulate language (use); and other times, he uses large-scale typological data. Besides NLP and machine learning, he also employs Bayesian models; game theory; and information theory in his daily research.\n",
