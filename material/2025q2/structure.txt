TO DO:
  - Sketch out the first parts on POS and NER using spaCy intuitively. Make them do a lot by hand
  - Assignment for session 2: https://course.spacy.io/en/chapter1, section 5 - 7
  - Read Jurafsky & Martin Chapter 8 up to 8.4 (read further if interested)
  - [Use J&M Chapter 8 exercises for in session training]

Session 1:
- General overview
	- What is linguistic structure (syntax, semantics, morphology, ...)
	- What is NLP:
		- Rule-based
		- Symbolic approached
		- Distributed approaches
	- What tasks are there in NLP
- Everyone introduces themselves and what they expect from the class
- Exercises on basic tokenization, normalisation

Session 2:
- Regex
- Using spaCy: Tokenization, normalization

Session 3: Tagging (PoS & Named Entities)
- What is a PoS? Thrax and the tradition of POS as models
- Named entities (proper names)
- Tasks: POS tagging; and NER (both subsumed under "sequence labelling tasks)
- Baselines: What are they good for? What is a good baseline? Discuss Most Frequent Class Baseline
- Difference between POS and NER: segmentation for the latter
- EX:
 - Manually tag two sentences. Discuss




Session N:
- Language models and deep learning
