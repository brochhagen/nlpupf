    "# Session 06: (Character-level) language modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "After having briefly used LLMs (session 04) and having looked at how a simpler neural network can learn (session 05), we return to LLMs with a greater understanding for their inside workings; review main concepts; and put them to practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this stage, you should be able to read the diagram of a neural network. For instance, an abstract diagram like this one:\n",
