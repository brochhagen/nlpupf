# NLP session 03: Preparation for next session

* Read chapter 1.3 (["Transformers, what can they do?"](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/3?fw=pt )), up until the end of the chapter ("Summary") of the [Hugging Face tutorial](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1): [https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/3?fw=pt](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/3?fw=pt )
* Recommended: Start preparing the first lecture of [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html). We will probably not start discussing the material until the week after but since the video is long you may want a headstart.

### Optional

There are three topics you could introduce next week. This would count toward your in-class participation grade. If you want to present one of them, announce this on this week's forum on Aula Global. In this way, others will know that the topic is already taken. 

  1. Give an introduction to *word embeddings*. You are free to choose how you go about this. Be creative and pedagogically mindful. This counts twice for participation credit.
  
  2. Give an introduction to *scalars*, *vectors*, *matrices*, and *tensors*. You are free to choose how you go about this. Be creative and pedagogically mindful. This counts twice for participation credit.
  
  3. Give an explanation of what a *derivative* is. You are free to choose how you go about this. Be creative and pedagogically mindful.
