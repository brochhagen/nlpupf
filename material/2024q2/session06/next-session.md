# NLP session 06: Preparation for next session
 * Watch the final lecture of [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) (Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out).
 * Read Chapter 1, *Introduction to human-in-the-loop machine learning*, from the book "Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning" (PDF in Aula Global)
 
 
### Recommended

 * Read Yoav Goldberg's [A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00726), at least until page 35

### Optional

There is one topic you could introduce next week. This would count toward your in-class participation grade. If you want to present it, announce this on this week's forum on Aula Global. In this way others will know that the topic is already taken. 

  1. Give an introduction to *Active learning*, based on Chapter 1 from *Introduction to human-in-the-loop machine learning* (focus on subsection 1.3). Use Zhang et al.'s [A Survey of Active Learning for Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10109.pdf) or other online resources as secondary resources to illustrate how active learning can be useful for NLP. This counts as two in-class participation grades.
