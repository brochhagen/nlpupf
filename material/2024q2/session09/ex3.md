# Exercise 3: Open exercise

This exercise counts 30% toward your final grade. Your task is to write a brief report on an NLP-related project. You are free to choose. As before, the report should be a PDF document; no longer than 2 pages. It should include the sections described below. The 2-page limit does not include references (optional); supplementary material (optional); and the list of contributions (only if working in groups).

If you cannot think of any particular project of interest to you, feel free to build on your work from Exercise 2. The grading will be adjusted for the 5% extra that this exercise is worth so do make sure to present a clean and clear expansion of your previous work.

***

### Introduction (10%)

Introduce your project. What is it about? Why is it interesting? What narrower question will you explore and why? Explain your expectations prior to conducting the analysis.

### Material and methods (20%)
Describe your approach to answer the question, as well as the data you will be using: where did you get it? how did you process it?

### Results (40%)
Your main results. Were your expectations met? Do you think your results would generalize to other data of the same kind? Why (not)? Discuss limitations of your data and methods.

### Code (30%: 20% replicability/10% clarity)
Make your code publicly available (hosted on, e.g., [OSF](https://osf.io/) or [github](https://github.com/)). Remember to extensively comment it. Mention the dependencies that need to be fulfilled to run the code.

### List of contributions (unlimited space / only if working in groups)
Who did what in your group. You can use the [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/) system or a variant thereof.
